Class Attendance using Face Recognition (Haar Cascade) #Python #Open CV

First, we need to install few packages - 

pyfiglet, appdirs, attrs, black, Click, cycler, demjson4, kiwisolver, matplotlib, nose, numpy, opencv-contrib-python, pandas, Pillow, pyparsing, python-dateutil, pytz, six, toml, virtualenv, xlrd, xmltodict, yagmail, yapf.

After installing all these packages - 

1. Run the main.py module.

2. You'll see a few options pop up.

3. Select option 1 (enter number 1) to check if your camera is working properly. Press Escape to close the camera and go back to previous.

4. Select option 2 (enter number 2). Enter your Roll Number (only numbers allowed), press enter and then enter your name (for ex: G S Sumith).
   The camera tab will pop up and recognize your face. Twist your head to left, right, up, down so that the camera captures your face's every angle.
   It will quit automatically after 10 seconds.
   
5. Select option 3 (enter number 3). The algorithm will train itself with the images within seconds.

6. Select option 4 (enter number 4) for the camera to pop up and start recognizing your face. You will see your name in the box which recognizes your face.
   Press Escape once you see your name (it is enough even if it recognizes and shows your name only once).
   
7. Select option 5 (enter number 5) to quit the program.




To look at your attendance sheet, go to the folder called "Attendance" and there you can see a excel sheet which consists of your Roll number, Name, Date and Time Stamp.
If you want to see your images that was captured by the camera, open the "training_images" folder.
